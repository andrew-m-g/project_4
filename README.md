# project_4
**Project Objective:**  The purpose of our project was to create machine learning models to analyze and predict  the diagnosis of heart disease in patients using labeled data.

andrew_cardio_data_rdfrst
    -imported and cleaned a the given dataset
    -created a smaller data set with two equally large groups of patients WITH and WITH OUT heart disease to train the model
    -created, trained and tested a random forest model, then displayed the accuracy results and visualized the feature importance of the model
    -exported the model into a pickle file "cardio_rf_model.pkl" for future use

**Conclusion**
We conclude that the best model for an application such as this is Random Forest. While all three models gave very similar results of 73-74%, Random forest is the best at handling the complexity that comes with so many features.
